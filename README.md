Bit is a distributed, fast and language-agnostic code component manager designed for easy use, maintenance and discovery of code components.

**Easily reuse code components:** Bit is an open source tool for fast and easy extraction and reuse of code components. No more code duplications, no more micro-packages.

**Easy to maintain:** Bit makes component maintenance super easy with features like isolated component environment, simple minor versioning and more.

**Simple to find:** Bit uses a functional search and a simple yet smart scoping mechanism to easily find components created by you or your team. Thanks to the component isolated environment, components can be built and run anywhere.

Bit currently supports JavaScript. We plan to add drivers for more languages as soon as we can. We always love some help.

## Features

* **Fast & Easy component export.** Easily export a component to be reused anywhere by you or your team - all in less than a minute.
* **Code environment boilerplate.** Components are isolated, and contain their own full working environment, ready to be shipped and used anywhere.
* **Components can build and run anywhere.** Thanks to the Bit component environment. 
* **Simplified minor versioning.** Components versions is incremental for easier update and maintenance.
* **Internal search engine.** Find code components in local and remote locations.
* **On-export dependency resolution.** All dependencies are kept with your component, to keep components immutable while downloading.
* **Distributed.** Multiple backups, works offline and supports any workflow.
