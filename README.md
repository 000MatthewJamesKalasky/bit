Bit is a distributed, fast and language-agnostic code component manager designed for easy use, maintenance and discovery of code components.

**Easily reuse code components:** Open source tool for fast and easy extraction and reuse of code components without creating code duplications or having to publish tiny packages.

**Easy to maintain:** Easily maintain all your components in one place. Isolated component environment and simplified versioning make life even easier.

**Simple to find:** A built-in functional search and a simple scoping mechanism make it simple to find components created by you, your team or the community. Thanks to the component isolated environment, components can be built and run anywhere.

Bit currently supports JavaScript. We plan to add drivers for more languages as soon as we can. We always love some help.

## Features

* **Fast & Easy component export.** Easily export a component to be reused anywhere by you or your team - all in less than a minute.
* **Code environment boilerplate.** Components are isolated, and contain their own full working environment, ready to be shipped and used anywhere.
* **Components can build and run anywhere.** Thanks to the Bit component environment. 
* **Simplified minor versioning.** Components versions is incremental for easier update and maintenance.
* **Internal search engine.** Find code components in local and remote locations.
* **On-export dependency resolution.** All dependencies are kept with your component, to keep components immutable while downloading.
* **Distributed.** Multiple backups, works offline and supports any workflow.
