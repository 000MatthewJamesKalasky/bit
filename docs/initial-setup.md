# create-local-scope

Scopeâ€™s responsibility is to store and manage the components lifecycle. It's recommended to create the scope at the root of a project. You can create as many scopes as you need.

**type the following in the command line.**

* `mkdir hello-world` Create an empty directory.

* `bit init` Initialize an empty scope.

This generates a `bit.json` file and a `.bit` directory.
