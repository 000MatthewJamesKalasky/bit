Bit is a distributed code component manager designed for easy use, maintenance and discovery of code components.

It allows you to extract code components from your code in seconds and reuse them across repositories and microservices without creating duplications.

Components are stored and managed in [Scopes](Glossary#scopes).

Scopes takes care of your components entire lifecycle from storing and version management, through build and test execution all the way to faster dependency management. It also makes your components easy to find with a built-in semantic search and a simple scoping mechanism.

To learn the basics of Bit, head over to the [Getting started](Getting-Started) guide. Additional commands can be found [here](CLI-Reference).

Give it a try.
